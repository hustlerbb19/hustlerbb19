# Bennett Bernstein üó≥Ô∏è üìà üîµ ÔøΩ

Hello üëã. My name is Bennett Bernstein, I'm an applied political data scientist with experience at the intersection of civic engagement and contemporary machine learning. Today, I'm employed as a Senior Data Scientist at [BlueLabs Analytics](https://bluelabs.com/), where I work to promote Democratic campaigns and advance progressive causes. I'm also a master's student in the [Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](https://www.qmss.columbia.edu/) program at Columbia University. 

My prior professional experience includes stints as:
- **Lead Data Scientist** on the *Cory 2020* presidential campaign, where I developed novel targeting and forecasting deliverables informing strategic resource allocation advancing the cadidacy of Senator Booker in the Democratic presidential primary
- **Product Data Lead** at civic tech startup [*Hustle*](https://hustle.com/), where I prototyped NLP-driven product suggestion features embeded within the business' core peer-to-peer organizing platform
- **Deputy State Data & Analytics Director** on the *Hillary for America* presidential campaign in Nevada, where I build decision tools leveraged by state leadership to evaluate program execution and targeting strategies in the 2016 general election

My academic research interests include Bayesian techniques for survey-based inference and electoral forecasting, statistical methods for mediating machine bias, and deep learning for tweet-scale natural language processing problems.
