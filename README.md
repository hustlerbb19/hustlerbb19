# Bennett Bernstein 🗳️ 📈 🔵

Hello 👋. My name is Bennett Bernstein, I'm an applied political data scientist with experience at the intersection of civic engagement and contemporary machine learning. Today, I work as a Senior Data Scientist at [BlueLabs Analytics](https://bluelabs.com/) where I work to promote Democratic campaigns and advance progressive causes. I'm also a master's student in the [Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](https://www.qmss.columbia.edu/) program at Columbia University. 

My prior professional experience includes tours as:
- Lead Data Scientist on the Cory Booker 2020 presidential campaign, where I developed novel targeting and forecasting deliverables informing strategic resource allocation
- Product Data Lead at civic tech startup [Hustle](https://hustle.com/), where I prototyped NLP-driven product suggestion features embeded within the business' peer-to-peer organizing platform
- Deputy Data & Analytics Director for the state of Nevada on the Hillary for America presidential campaign, where I build descision tools leveraged by state leadership to evaluate program execution and targeting strategies

My academic research interests include Bayesian techniques for survey-based inference and electoral forecasting, statistical methods for mediating machine bias, and deep learning for tweet-scale natural language processing problems.
