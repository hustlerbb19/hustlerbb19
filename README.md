# Bennett Bernstein üó≥Ô∏è üìà üîµ

Hello üëã. My name is Bennett Bernstein, I'm an applied political data scientist with experience at the intersection of civic engagement and contemporary machine learning. Today, I work as a Senior Data Scientist at [BlueLabs Analytics](https://bluelabs.com/) where I work to promote Democratic campaigns and advance progressive causes. I'm also a master's student in the [Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences](https://www.qmss.columbia.edu/) program at Columbia University. 

My prior professional experience includes tours as:
- **Lead Data Scientist** on the *Cory Booker 2020* presidential campaign, where I developed novel targeting and forecasting deliverables informing strategic resource allocation
- **Product Data Lead** at civic tech startup [*Hustle*](https://hustle.com/), where I prototyped NLP-driven product suggestion features embeded within the business' peer-to-peer organizing platform
- **Nevada Deputy Data & Analytics Director** on the *Hillary for America* presidential campaign, where I build descision tools leveraged by state leadership to evaluate program execution and targeting strategies

My academic research interests include Bayesian techniques for survey-based inference and electoral forecasting, statistical methods for mediating machine bias, and deep learning for tweet-scale natural language processing problems.

I earned my undergradute degree in chemistry at Princeton University, where I performed lab research in the [Arnold Group](https://spikelab.mycpanel.princeton.edu/research/energy.html) focused on secondary battery system technologies for intermittent renewable electricity generation applicaitons.
